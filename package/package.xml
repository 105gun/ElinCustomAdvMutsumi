This mod adds a separate adventurer, 若葉睦 Wakaba Mutsumi (From TV Anime 『BanG Dream!』Series), who specializes in the use of guitars and throwing objects.
You can find her on the adventurer rank list, no matter new savefile or not.
(No custom dialogs have been added yet, with future plans)

Note: This mod isn't finished yet, I need to at least finish her portrait...</description>
